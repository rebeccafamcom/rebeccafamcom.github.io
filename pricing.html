  <h1>Pricing</h1>
  <p>Compared to most other professional web development businesses, we try to keep prices low. While you could pay thousands of dollars for a large company to create a website for you, we understand that that is a huge investment. We’ve made our prices lower so you can have a quality website without having to break the bank.</p>

    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Service</th>
        <th>Price</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>Development</td>
        <td>$25 per page</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Design</td>
        <td>$35 per page</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Both</td>
        <td>$50 per page</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Hosting (you must pay for your domain name!)</td>
        <td>$10 per month</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Upkeep (includes changes to text, changes to code, etc.)</td>
        <td>$10 per month</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
  <p>So, according to our chart, a website like ours would cost you only $200, plus a $20 monthly fee for hosting and upkeep. If you’re looking to make the leap onto the web, or if you’re ready to graduate from your template website, then look no further. Our business was made for people just like you.</p>
