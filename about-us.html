  <h1>About Us</h1>
  <p>Schmit’s Web Design and Development started out as just one person. Actually, it’s still just me, Rebecca Schmit. I say “we” everywhere, but it’s just planning for the future. My business is brand new. However, I have plans to grow this into a large company.</p>
  <p>I envision this as a group that can handle everything you need to create a high quality website on a budget. While services like Weebly and Wix may work fine to start off with, those website creators cannot accommodate every odd request that you may have. We’ll do everything that you need to create a website with all the features that you want.</p>
