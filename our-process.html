    <h1>Our Process</h1>
    <p>We use a 3 step process when creating our websites. In fact, we used that process to create the very website you’re on right now. Want to see what it is? Just scroll on down.</p>

      <h3>Step 1: Sketches and Text</h3>
    </div>
    <p>In order to code our websites, we need to know what we need to code. We create basic sketches for each page on the website. At this point in the process, we will also ask for all of the text that you would like on the website. Without knowing what we have to work with, we wouldn’t be able to do layout.</p>

      <h3>Step 2: Development</h3>
    </div>
    <p>Now that we have an idea of what we’re making, we do everything involved in web development. We create a functioning version on the website at this point. While it doesn’t look pretty, it contains all of the basic elements of the site, including links, tables, headers, and images.</p>

      <h3>Step 3: Design</h3>
    </div>
    <p>This is the final step. It consists of everything that makes the website look pretty. It takes a white page with some links and text and turns it into something that actually represents your business. We work with you closely at this stage. Every client will want a slightly different aesthetic for their website, so we’ll be spending a lot of time getting to know yours. <br><br>
    After going through our entire process, you’ll have a complete website. You’ll have full access to the files if you want to use your own hosting service, or you can let us handle the hosting. We’re flexible like that. You are our clients. Our job is the make you the website that you want.</p>
